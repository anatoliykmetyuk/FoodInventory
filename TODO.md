- [ ] Fridge: should be able to CRUD items. This operation does NOT affect existing meals.
- [ ] Calories on the cooking page and elsewhere: should be formatted to 2 decimal places.
- [ ] Fridge: item layout should be a list, even on desktop.
- [ ] Cooking: should be able to delete meals. When deleting a meal, restore used percentages of ingredients to the fridge - but only if the item is still available in the fridge, otherwise do nothing. Items are uniquely identified by their ID (and NOT by name, check and enforce this).
- [ ] Meal: once created, should be immutable. That is, percentage used cannot be changed after creation, ingredients cannot be deleted.
- [ ] Statistics: chart should reflect the currency of the user's account in the vertical axis.
- [ ] Statistics: when hovering over a data point, the popup moves around for some reason. Fix this, should stay in place.
- [ ] Statistics: should be possible to click on the entries in the popup to navigate to the entry's respective page (Meal or Shopping Event).
