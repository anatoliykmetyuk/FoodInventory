Transcribe me everything that I purchased as a list. Prices-wise, you will include both the price listed in the table as well as the final price - after tax and discounts. You see at the bottom there is tax. So, both prices need to be included. And please, the output needs to be in fucking English, alright?

The following keys must be present for each item:

- Item - the name of the item, in English.
- Listed Price - the price of the item as listed on the receipt.
- Final Price - the price of the item after tax and discounts.
- Estimated Calories - the estimated calories of the item.

The output needs to be in JSON format.
