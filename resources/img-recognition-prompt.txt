Transcribe me everything that I purchased as a list. Extract the listed price (the price shown in the item table) for each item. Also extract the tax rate for the entire receipt (as a percentage number, e.g., 8.5 for 8.5%). Look at the bottom of the receipt to find the tax rate. And please, the output needs to be in English, alright?

The output must be a JSON object with the following structure:

- "items" - an array of objects, each with:
  - "Item" - the name of the item, in English.
  - "Listed Price" - the price of the item as listed on the receipt (before tax).
- "taxRate" - a single number representing the tax rate for the entire receipt as a percentage (e.g., 8.5 for 8.5%, 0 if no tax).

The output needs to be in JSON format.
